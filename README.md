# window_web_app
A web application that allows users to create accounts and login in, as well as setting their preference for a default country. Our site will show webcam footage from the last 24 hours from public cameras all over the world. Upon signing in, users will view footage from a random camera from their selected country (which can be changed at any time). Users can also search cameras by country, category, or both, and they can select from a list of results to view a certain camera. Upon viewing camera footage, current weather information is also displayed for that location. Users can like cameras and save them to their account, and can view cameras that are most liked around the world, and also view their own likes on separate pages. 

API Fetch Calls:
